# hargassner-monitoring
Monitoring of Hargassner heating while pulling data from Hargassner Web-API.

# Preconditions

* Hargassner heating installation sends data vie its Internet Gateway to Hargassner
server __and__ you have an account for [Hargassner WEB-APP](https://web.hargassner.at) / APP.
* Required SW for pulling data:
  * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  * [InfluxDB V2](https://www.influxdata.com/)


# Functional Building Blocks

![Functional Building Blocks](./imgs/fbb.drawio.png)

* Hargassner heating installation with Internet Gateway sends data to Hargassner web service
* Python code  of `hargassner_web_api_pull` retrieves data and stores it into InfluxDB
* Data is visualized with Grafana Dashboards

# Usage

* Rename `config_template.yml` to `config.yml` and fill in required information
* Install dependencies with `poetry install`
* Execute:
  * Single run: execute `poetry run python hargassner_web_api_pull/hg_data_pull.py`
  * Run it in a shell-loop every two minutes: `./pull_data.sh`

## In case you get 401 during Hargassner login and you are sure that user / password are correct

To log into the Hargassner web API one also needs `client_id` and `client_secret`. This is configured
in `config.yml` and usually does not need to be changed. If you think you need to change it, follow
this procedure:

1. Open https://web.hargassner.at in browser
2. Open the network analysis console of the browser (F12 in Firefox, tab "Network analysis")
3. Log into the web application with your user / password
4. Find the `POST https://web.hargassner.at/api/auth/login` call in the trace
5. Switch to the `Request` tab, copy values from the variables `client_id` and `client_secret`
