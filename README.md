# hargassner-monitoring
Monitoring of Hargassner heating while pulling data from Hargassner Web-API.

## Features
* Pulls data from Hargassner Web-API
* Configuration of credentials for Hargassner Web-API or InfluxDB via YMAL configuraton file
* Extracts widget names and values automatically and stores them into InluxDB: The 
widget name serves as measurement name in InfluxDB and the installation information (ID, name, slug)
are used as tags.
* Maps state names to numerical values for persitance with InfluxDB, see [Status value mappings](#status-value-mappings)
* Verbose logging into rotating files (5 files, max 10 MB per file)
* Console log level can be configured via configuration file

## Visualization of Data

# Preconditions

* Hargassner heating installation sends data vie its Internet Gateway to Hargassner
server __and__ you have an account for [Hargassner WEB-APP](https://web.hargassner.at) / APP.
* Required SW for pulling data:
  * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  * [InfluxDB V2](https://www.influxdata.com/)
* Required SW for viewing data:
  * [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)


# Functional Building Blocks

![Functional Building Blocks](./imgs/fbb.drawio.png)

* Hargassner heating installation with Internet Gateway sends data to Hargassner web service
* Python code  of `hargassner_web_api_pull` retrieves data and stores it into InfluxDB
* Data is visualized with Grafana Dashboards

# Usage

## Pull data from Hargassner Web

* Rename `config_template.yml` to `config.yml` and fill in required information
* Install dependencies with `poetry install`
* Execute options:
  * Single run: execute `poetry run python hargassner_web_api_pull/hg_data_pull.py`
  * Run it in a shell-loop every minute: `./pull_data.sh`
  * Use [crontab](https://linuxize.com/post/scheduling-cron-jobs-with-crontab/) to run it regularly as long as system is up

## View data with Grafana

* Add InfluxDB instance as data source to Grafana
* Import dashboard provided in `grafana` directory


# Status value mappings

# Error Handling

## In case you get 401 during Hargassner login and you are sure that user / password are correct

To log into the Hargassner web API one also needs `client_id` and `client_secret`. This is configured
in `config.yml` and usually does not need to be changed. If you think you need to change it, follow
this procedure:

1. Open https://web.hargassner.at in browser
2. Open the network analysis console of the browser (F12 in Firefox, tab "Network analysis")
3. Log into the web application with your user / password
4. Find the `POST https://web.hargassner.at/api/auth/login` call in the trace
5. Switch to the `Request` tab, copy values from the variables `client_id` and `client_secret`
